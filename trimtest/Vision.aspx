	<h2>How we work</h2>
	<p>
		For most of our work, the approach that has worked best is generally comprised of the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Define Objectives and Requirements</li>
		<li>Evaluate Options and Alternatives</li>
		<li>Design Draft or Prototype for Approval</li>
		<li>Research Subject Matter</li>
		<li>Develop Content</li>
		<li>Test and Review</li>
		<li>Edit and Recover</li>
		<li>Approval</li>
		<li>Delivery</li>
		<li>Maintenance (where necessary)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Not all the steps are always necessary of course, but it's always best to stay focussed and organized at all times.</p>
	<h3>Technical Tools</h3>
	<p>
		We leverage information technology to every extent possible. And we're always learning new and exciting things about business. <a href="Toolset.aspx" title="Toolset">Check out our IT factory</a>.</p>
